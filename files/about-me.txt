I'm Anshuman Mohanty, a deeply curious Data Scientist with a Master's in Applied Data Science from USC. I specialize in transforming complex raw data into real-world solutions using Deep Learning, Generative AI, NLP, and forecasting.

My approach balances advanced research with pragmatic application. I have authored two published papers in the domain of Sales Forecasting and Object Detection and delivered measurable professional impact.

With experience ranging from deep learning research to deploying scalable pipelines on AWS at organizations like Klickly and Dr. Reddy's, I am a collaborative problem-solver ready to build the next generation of AI-powered solutions.
